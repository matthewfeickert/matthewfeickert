# Welcome!

I'm a research scientist in high energy physics and [data science](https://datascience.wisc.edu/institute/) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison working on the ATLAS experiment and as part of the [Institute for Research and Innovation in Software for High Energy Physics (IRIS-HEP)](https://iris-hep.org/).
I'm a Pythonista and along with being a core developer of [`pyhf`](https://github.com/scikit-hep/pyhf) I additionally work on developing the Pythonic data analysis ecosystem in particle physics as a member of [Scikit-HEP](https://scikit-hep.org/).
I'm also starting to get more interested in the sustainability of high impact scientific software.

If you want to chat find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/HEPfeickert), and if you want to discuss something with me or collaborate send me an email.
Happy coding! :rocket:
